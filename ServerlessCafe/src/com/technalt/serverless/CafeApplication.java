/**
 * The ChatAppliation class serves as the Model (in the sense of the common
 * user interface design pattern known as Model-View-Controller) for the chat
 * application. 
 *
 * The ChatApplication inherits from the relatively little-known Android 
 * application framework class Application.  From the Android developers
 * reference on class Application:
 * 
 *   Base class for those who need to maintain global application state.
 *   You can provide your own implementation by specifying its name in your
 *   AndroidManifest.xml's <application> tag, which will cause that class to
 *   be instantiated for you when the process for your application/package is
 *   created.
 *   
 * The important property of class Application is that its lifetime coincides
 * with the lifetime of the application, not its activities.  Since we have
 * persistent state in our connections to the outside world via our AllJoyn
 * objects, and that state cannot be serialized, saved and restored; we need
 * a persistent object to ensure that state is held if transient objects like
 * Activities are destroyed and recreated by the Android application framework
 * during its normal operation.
 * 
 * This object holds the global state for our chat application, and starts the
 * Android Service that handles the background processing relating to our
 * AllJoyn connections.
 * 
 * Additionally, this class provides the Model for an MVC framework.  It 
 * provides a relatively abstract idea of what it is the application is doing.
 * For example, we provide methods oriented to conceptual actions (like our
 * user has typed a message) instead of methods oriented to the implementation
 * (like, create an AllJoyn bus object and register it).  This allows the
 * user interface to be relatively independent of the channel implementation.
 * 
 * Android Activities can come and go in sometimes surprising ways during the
 * operation of an application.  For example, when a phone is rotated from
 * portrait to landscape orientation, the displayed Activities are deleted
 * and recreated in the new orientation.  This class holds the persistent
 * state that is required to correctly display Activities when they are
 * recreated.

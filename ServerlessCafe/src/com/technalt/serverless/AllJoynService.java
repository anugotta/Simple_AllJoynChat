         * thus signals (which correspond to our chat messages) will begin to
         * flow from the hosted chat channel as soon as we begin to host a
         * corresponding session.
         * 
         * To achieve sane user interface behavior, we need to block those
         * signals from the implicit join done by the bind until our user joins
         * the bound chat channel.  If we do not do this, the chat messages
         * from the chat channel hosted by the application will appear in the
         * chat channel joined by the application.
         *
         * Since the messages flow automatically, we can accomplish this by
         * turning a filter on and off in the chat signal handler.  So if we
         * detect that we are hosting a channel, and we find that we want to
         * join the hosted channel we turn the filter off.
         * 
         * We also need to be able to send chat messages to the hosted channel.
         * This means we need to point the mChatInterface at the session ID of
         * the hosted session.  There is another complexity here since the
         * hosted session doesn't exist until a remote session has joined.
         * This means that we don't have a session ID to use to create a
         * SignalEmitter until a remote device does a joinSession on our
         * hosted session.  This, in turn, means that we have to create the
         * SignalEmitter after we get a sessionJoined() callback in the 
         * SessionPortListener passed into bindSessionPort().  We chose to
         * create the signal emitter for this case in the sessionJoined()
         * callback itself.  Note that this hosted channel signal emitter
         * must be distinct from one constructed for the usual joinSession
         * since a hosted channel may have a remote device do a join at any
         * time, even when we are joined to another session.  If they were
         * not separated, a remote join on the hosted session could redirect
         * messages from the joined session unexpectedly.
         * 
         * So, to summarize, these next few lines handle a relatively complex
         * case.  When we host a chat channel, we do a bindSessionPort which
         * *enables* the creation of a session.  As soon as a remote device
         * joins the hosted chat channel, a session is actually created, and
         * the SessionPortListener sessionJoined() callback is fired.  At that
         * point, we create a separate SignalEmitter using the hosted session's
         * sessionId that we can use to send chat messages to the channel we
         * are hosting.  As soon as the session comes up, we begin receiving
         * chat messages from the session, so we need to filter them until the
         * user joins the hosted chat channel.  In a separate timeline, the
         * user can decide to join the chat channel she is hosting.  She can
         * do so either before or after the corresponding session has been
         * created as a result of a remote device joining the hosted session. 
         * If she joins the hosted channel before the underlying session is
         * created, her chat messages will be discarded.  If she does so after
         * the underlying session is created, there will be a session emitter
         * waiting to use to send chat messages.  In either case, the signal
         * filter will be turned off in order to listen to remote chat
         * messages.
